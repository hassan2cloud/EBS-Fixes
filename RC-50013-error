Cause:
It was determined that the RUN WLS Admin services were modified.
What modifications were made is not important.

The issue is that on source when adpreclone.pl appsTier was run the
$COMMON_TOP/adopclone_/FMW/WLS/plan/moveplan.xml was not updated to match the $FMW_HOME/config.xml file

Then when adcfgclone attempts to valid OHS home it fails.

Solution:
Delete the $COMMON_TOP/adopclone_<hostname> directory on source and run adpreclone.pl appsTier to make the directory fresh again.
